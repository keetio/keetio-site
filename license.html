    <h1>Terms of Service (License Agreement)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 10 November 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your use of the Keetio mobile application and related services (the “<strong>App</strong>”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>

    <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> to use the App.</p>

    <h2>3) Your account</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of your profile information and for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account.</li>
      <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or our policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Paid features may be offered via in-app purchases and subscriptions managed by the relevant app store (e.g., Google Play) and by our subscription partner (RevenueCat).</li>
      <li>Prices, billing cycles, renewals, free trials and refunds are governed by the app store’s rules and applicable law. Where permitted, you can manage or cancel subscriptions in your app store account settings.</li>
      <li>We do not store complete payment card details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Acceptable Use & Safety</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Be respectful. Do not harass, threaten, impersonate, or share illegal, harmful, hateful, or sexually explicit content.</li>
      <li>No spam, scraping, reverse engineering, or interference with the App’s normal operation.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to obtain or reveal another person’s exact location or private information without consent. Keetio’s map uses privacy-preserving offsets.</li>
      <li>We may remove content or take action to protect users and the service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) User Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You retain rights to content you submit (e.g., greetings, messages, photos), but grant Keetio a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, process, transmit, display and otherwise use such content solely to operate and improve the App.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to share any content you upload.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is subject to our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>8) Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may rely on third-party services (e.g., Firebase, Crashlytics, RevenueCat, Google Play Services). Your use of such services may be subject to their terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>9) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App, including software, trademarks, logos, and content provided by Keetio, is owned by or licensed to Keetio and protected by law.</li>
      <li>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Keetio grants you a personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the App for your personal, non-commercial use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available”. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied (including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, and non-infringement). We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>

    <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Keetio will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, or loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the App. Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>12) Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Keetio harmless from claims arising out of your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>13) Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if we discontinue the App. Upon termination, sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitations of liability) will survive.</p>

    <h2>14) Governing Law & Disputes (Global)</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>England and Wales</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You and Keetio submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
    <p><em>Consumer law protection:</em> If you reside in a country with mandatory consumer protection laws, nothing in these Terms deprives you of the protections of those laws, and you may be entitled to bring claims in your local courts.</p>

    <h2>15) Changes to the App and to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify or discontinue features at any time. We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version and revise the “Last updated” date above. Material changes may also be notified in-app.</p>
