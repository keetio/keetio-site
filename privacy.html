    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 14 October 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Keetio</strong> (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application and related services (the “App”).
      By using Keetio you agree to this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      Data Controller: <strong>Keetio</strong><br/>
      Contact: <a href="mailto:info@keetio.app">info@keetio.app</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2) What we collect</h2>
    <p>Depending on how you use the App, we may process the following categories of data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account &amp; profile:</strong> email/UID (from sign-in), display name, age range, gender, bio, preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>User content:</strong> greetings, messages, photos/videos you choose to upload or capture in-app.</li>
      <li><strong>Device &amp; usage data:</strong> app version, device model, OS, timestamps, crash/diagnostic data, and generic interaction events (e.g., which screens were opened) for stability and analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> approximate or precise location if you grant permission, to enable map-based features.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera/Microphone/Photos:</strong> accessed only after your consent to capture or select media inside the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchases &amp; subscriptions:</strong> purchase tokens/identifiers and receipts from <em>Google Play Billing</em> processed via <em>RevenueCat</em> to activate and manage your subscription. We do not store full payment card data.</li>
      <li><strong>Support:</strong> information you send us by email or in-app forms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Why we use your data</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>6) Data storage &amp; retention</h2>

      <li>We keep account and subscription data for as long as your account is active and as required by law (e.g., taxation).</li>
      <li>Content you delete is removed or anonymized from our active systems within a reasonable period, subject to backups and legal holds.</li>
      <li>Crash/analytics data is retained only as needed for troubleshooting and trend analysis.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>You may edit your profile, delete content, or cancel your subscription in the App/Play Store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Your rights (GDPR/EEA/UK)</h2>
    <p>You may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, or object to certain processing. You also have the right to withdraw consent at any time (this does not affect processing before withdrawal).
