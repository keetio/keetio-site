  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 14 October 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Keetio</strong> (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application and related services (the “App”).
    By using Keetio you agree to this Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Data Controller: <strong>Keetio </strong><br/>
    Contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@keetio.app">privacy@keetio.app</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2) What we collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the App, we may process the following categories of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & profile:</strong> email/UID (from sign-in), display name, age range, gender, bio, preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>User content:</strong> greetings, messages, photos/videos you choose to upload or capture in-app.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> app version, device model, OS, timestamps, crash/diagnostic data, and generic interaction events (e.g., which screens were opened) for stability and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> approximate or precise location if you grant permission, to enable map-based features.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera/Microphone/Photos:</strong> accessed only after your consent to capture or select media inside the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases & subscriptions:</strong> purchase tokens/identifiers and receipts from <em>Google Play Billing</em> processed via <em>RevenueCat</em> to activate and manage your subscription. We do not store full payment card data.</li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> information you send us by email or in-app forms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Why we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide the service:</strong> create/manage your account, send greetings/messages, show nearby users on the map, restore purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions & billing:</strong> verify purchases, manage renewals, handle refunds/cancellations.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety & moderation:</strong> prevent abuse, enforce our Terms, and keep the community safe.</li>
    <li><strong>App quality:</strong> fix crashes, measure performance, and improve features.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> meet legal, tax, and accounting obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)): to provide the core App features and subscriptions you request.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)): for optional permissions such as camera, microphone, notifications, and location.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)): fraud prevention, security, and product improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)): record-keeping and compliance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Sharing with service providers (“processors”)</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share limited data with trusted providers who help us run the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play / Google LLC (incl. Firebase & Crashlytics):</strong> app distribution, billing tokens, analytics, crash reporting, push notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat, Inc.:</strong> subscription management and entitlement status (no full card details).</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud hosting & email providers:</strong> storage and support communication.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers act on our instructions under data-processing agreements. Data may be processed in the EU/EEA and/or the US with appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs).</p>

  <h2>6) Data storage & retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We keep account and subscription data for as long as your account is active and as required by law (e.g., taxation).</li>
    <li>Content you delete is removed or anonymized from our active systems within a reasonable period, subject to backups and legal holds.</li>
    <li>Crash/analytics data is retained only as needed for troubleshooting and trend analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can enable/disable optional permissions (Camera, Microphone, Location, Notifications) in your device settings at any time.</li>
    <li>You may edit your profile, delete content, or cancel your subscription in the App/Play Store.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Your rights (GDPR/EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>You may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, or object to certain processing. You also have the right to withdraw consent at any time (this does not affect processing before withdrawal). To exercise your rights, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@keetio.app">privacy@keetio.app</a>. You may lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority.</p>

  <h2>9) Children</h2>
  <p>Keetio is intended for individuals <strong>18+</strong>. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a minor has used the App, contact us and we will take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>10) Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; please use the App responsibly.</p>

  <h2>11) International transfers</h2>
  <p>If data is transferred outside your country, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect it.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the new version here and update the “Last updated” date above. Significant changes may also be notified in-app.</p>
